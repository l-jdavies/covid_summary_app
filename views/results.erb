      <h1>COVID Seven-Day Summary</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p><em>The term 'past seven-days' refers to the time period (YYYYMMDD) between <%= @current_date %> and <%= @seven_day_date %> whilst the term 'previous seven-days' refers to the time period between <%= @seven_day_date %> and <%= @fourteen_day_date %>.</em></p>
      <h3>Past seven-days</h3>
      <p>The following changes have occurred in the state of <%= @state %> over the past seven-days:
      <ul class="list-of-parameters">
        <% @change_results.each do |result| %>
          <li><%= result %>.</li>
        <% end %>
      </ul>
      <h3>Percentage changes</h3>
      <p>The changes that have occurred in <%= @state %> over the past seven-days differ from the previous seven-days by the following percent:</p>
      <ul class="list-of-parameters">
        <% @change_percent.each do |result| %>
          <li><%= result %></li>
            <% end %>
      </ul>
      <p>Note: if the number of individuals currently hospitalized has decreased in the past seven-days in comparison to the previous seven-days then a percentage change will not be displayed.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How the results are calculated</h2>
      <p>The results are calculated by obtaining data from <a href="https://covidtracking.com/">covidtracking.com</a> at three time points:</p>
      <ul class="list-of-parameters">
        <li>Day 0, which due to variation in when data is available, is yesterday.</li>
        <li>Day -7, which is 8 days prior to today.</li>
        <li>Day -14, which is 15 days prior to today.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To determine the changes that have occurred over the last seven-days, the data obtained on Day -7 is subtracted from the data on Day 0. The changes that have occurred over the previous seven-days are calculated by subtracting the data from Day -14 from the data on Day -7.</p>
